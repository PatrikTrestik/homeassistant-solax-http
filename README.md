# homeassistant-solax-http
This is Home Assistant integration for SolaX local API.
Work is based on https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus and all credits for initial conception work go there.

This has to be taken as only other mean of communication where Modbus is not possible.

Please write only issues specific to Http API here.
All other stuff is common and should be discussed in https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus

# Supported devices
Only SolaX EV Charger X3 is supported.
Let me know if you have other device and you are interested in integrating it. Physical device is required as there is no documentation available.
